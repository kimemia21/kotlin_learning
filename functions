   We define them using the keyword "fun"
   We use them to group code that does some particular jobs
   function can also be used to givr back a resulting value to its caller.
   The function defination concsist if a unique name after thw kryword and parenthesis after the unoque name
   - the parenthesis is where you put parameters
   example  
   fun greetings(){

   }
   After thr definations the function body is denoted by curly braces
   inside the body id where you write the code
   A function gives back a resulting valur to the caller if there is a  returning statemnet at the end od the code.
   -Functions  defination with a return function  must have a return type specified after the parenthesis.
